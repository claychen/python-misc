python-misc
===========

I am learning python. The way I learn new things is to read 
some material and reorganize them into piecies I could 
understand. Github is a wonderful place to store my pieces,
and the 'little green box' could remind me how long I haven't
contribute to this technics.

This project(directory?) is to store things I borrowed from the
net. Therefore, I have no credit for it. If you find something
useful, take it without saying a word. If you find something in
this project that is not cited properly and is very similiar 
to great articles or codes, please let me know to mark credits 
for all the job done by those great people.

Coding for FUN!
